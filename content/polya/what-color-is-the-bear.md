>A bear, starting from the point _P_, walked one mile due south.  Then he changed direction and walked one mile due east.  Then he turned again to the left and walked one mile due north, and arrived exactly at the point _P_ he started from.  What was the color of the bear?

I've encountered this brainteaser before, and I'm not sure how I feel about it appearing in this book, especially as the first problem.  Perhaps because it seems to depend on a sort of lie we tell ourselves, that due north at one point is parallel to another.  It's a _lie_, of course, but I still feel a bit iffy about making a counterintuitive truth the subject of the first exercise of the book.  Ideally, I think, the first problem would be one trivially solvable, but one that utilizes the steps of Polya's sequence.  Maybe I'm just griping pointlessly.  As mentioned, I've already encountered this problem, so I'm familiar with the solution.  I just don't think it's the best first problem.

Nevertheless:

I don't intend to do this for every problem, but I wanted to write down the first and second phases in detail at least once, not least because I'm trying out this Rocketbookâ„¢ and want to see how it'll work in practice.  So far, I've smudged a couple words and had some issues because of the way I hold my hand when I write.  (Can't I do _anything_ normally?  No, Other Nate, you can't.)

But I get frustrated with the speed of my handwriting, so I didn't really go in depth as much as I would've liked, so I'll do so below.

## Understanding the Problem
> **First, you have to _understand_ the problem.**

> _What is the unknown?  What are the data?  What is the condition?_

The unknown is the color of the bear.  The data are a set of movements taken by the bear.  The condition is along the lines of "what is the color _x_ of a bear such that it can start at a point _P_, walk due south one mile, due east one mile, and due north one mile, and arrive back at its starting point _P_?"

> Is it possible to satisfy the condition?  Is the condition sufficient to determine the unknown?  Or is it insufficient?  Or redundant?  Or contradictory?

The condition _seems_ incoherent and self-contradictory, and the unknown seems irrelevant or meaningless.

> Draw a figure.  Introduce suitable notation.

(See scan of solution.)

> Separate the various parts of the condition.  Can you write them down?

(See scan of solution.)

## Devising a Plan
> **Second, find the connection between the data and the unknown.  You may be obliged to consider auxiliary problems if an immediate connection cannot be found.  You should obtain eventually a _plan_ of the solution.**

> Have you seen [the problem] before?  Or have you seen the same problem in a slightly different form?

Yup :(

> _Do you know a related problem?_ Do you know a theorem that could be useful?

> _Look at the unknown!_  And try to think of a familiar problem having the same or a similar unknown.

> _Here is a problem related to yours and solved before.  Could you use it?_  Could you use its result?   Could you use its method?  Should you introduce some auxiliary element in order to make its use possible?

> Could you restate the problem?  Could you restate it still differently?  Go back to definitions.

> If you cannot solve the proposed problem try to solve first some related problem.  Could you imagine a more accessible related problem?  A more general problem?  A more special problem?  An analogous problem?  Could you solve part of the problem?  Keep only a part of the condition, drop the other part; how far is the unknown then determined, how can it vary?  Could you derive something useful from the data?  Could you think of other data appropriate to determine the unknown?  Could you change the unknown or the data, or both if necessary, so that the new unknown and the new data are nearer to each other?

> Did you use all the data?  Did you use the whole condition?  Have you taken into account all essential notions involved in the problem?

I think where Polya wanted me to go is to split this into two problems:

1. Something moves one mile south, one mile east, and one mile north, and arrives back at its starting position.  WTF?

2. What is the color of a bear that might live at a place where #1 is possible?

#2 is, merely by existing, both a hint to #1 and a sort of red herring.  It's weird enough to seem irrelevant.

## Carrying out the Plan

> **Third, _carry out_ your plan.**

> Carrying out your plan of the solution, _check each step_.  Can you see clearly that the step is correct?  Can you prove that it is correct?

So, phrasing it to be a little more well-formed:

> Is there a place on Earth such that you might move one mile due south, one mile due east, and one mile due north, and arrive at your starting position?

And the answer is: yes, at the North Pole.

## Looking Back

> **Fourth, _examine_ the solution obtained.**

> Can you _check the result_?  Can you check the argument?

> Can you derive the result differently?  Can you see it at a glance?

> Can you use the result, or the method, for some other problem?

And what color are bears at the North Pole?  They're white.

# Conclusion

As mentioned before, I don't intend to go this in-depth on each problem.  I'll probably copy and paste this format to successive posts and fill in what I think is necessary, and have a much-abbreviated scan as an image.
