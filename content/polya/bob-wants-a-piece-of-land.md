So let's look at Problem #2...

>Bob wants a piece of land, exactly level, which has four boundary lines.  Two boundary lines run exactly north-south, the two others exactly east-west, and each boundary line measures exactly 100 feet.  Can Bob buy such a piece of land in the U.S.?

Oh boy.

## Understanding the Problem
> **First, you have to _understand_ the problem.**

> _What is the unknown?  What are the data?  What is the condition?_

The unknown is whether or not these properties are contradictory for any land in the United States.  The data are that four boundary lines of a square each measure exactly 100 feet in length.  The conditions are that the boundary lines comprise exactly a square, and that two lines run north-south and the others east-west.

> Is it possible to satisfy the condition?  Is the condition sufficient to determine the unknown?  Or is it insufficient?  Or redundant?  Or contradictory?

I'm a bit hesitant to say so, suspecting a trick, but these conditions seem to me to be impossible to satisfy.  A perfect square with sides running north-south is not really possible in the United States.  God, GyÃ¶rg, don't make me rue the day I purchased your book.

> Draw a figure.  Introduce suitable notation.

## Devising a Plan
> **Second, find the connection between the data and the unknown.  You may be obliged to consider auxiliary problems if an immediate connection cannot be found.  You should obtain eventually a _plan_ of the solution.**

> Have you seen [the problem] before?  Or have you seen the same problem in a slightly different form?

Yes, this is a variation of the polar bear brainteaser.
