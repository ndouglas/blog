So as mentioned a couple times already, I've bought a bunch of books and my intent is to work through them.  I want to get better at mathematics and at computer science -- real computer science, not "merely" programming.  I'm not exactly renowned for my followthrough, so maybe this will go nowhere.  But I have done hard things in the past, and it would be good to do another.

Anyway, here is a tentative ordering of how I'd like to work through these books.  I haven't bothered putting down dates, for obvious reasons, but I hope to track my progress in This Very Blog.

- **_[How to Solve It: A New Aspect of Mathematical Method](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/4871878309/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)_, by George Polya.**  I hope that this will be a somewhat gentle reintroduction to solving math problems and "heuristic reasoning."  There are a number of references to geometry, which I was weak in, and it's possible that some of the problems will seriously challenge me.

- **_[How to Prove It: A Structured Approach](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521675995/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)_ by Daniel Velleman.**  I think this might form a nice companion, a "back half" to the "front half" of the Polya book.  Much of my study going forward will take the form of proofs, so I'd like to build a solid foundation there.

- **_[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262510871/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)_ by Harold Abelman and Gerald Sussman.**  I've begun reading it a time or two but didn't have the LISP handy.  I know it's reputed to be a demanding book, but I have to imagine it is one of the lighter ones on my list.

- **[How to Design Programs](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262534800/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)_ by Matthias Felleisen.**  I've heard this is sort of a companion and antidote to the weaknesses of _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_.  I'm hoping that it will deepen and reinforce whatever I get out of _SICP_.

- **_[Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262033844/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)_ by Thomas Cormen.**  This covers some ground that will be covered later by _The Art of Computer Programming_.  But I think covering it multiple times will be beneficial.  It is also my understanding that this is somewhat math-y, so while I think it's viewed as being easier going than _Concrete Mathematics_ and _The Art of Computer Programming_, I trust that it will still be challenging, rich, and complex.

- **_[Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201558025/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)_ by Ronald Graham, Donald Knuth, and Oren Patashnik.**  This is a solid tome, somewhat tortuous according to various comments.  I would guess it'll take about a year to work through, if all goes well.

- **_[The Art of Computer Programming](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321751043/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)_ by Donald Knuth.** This is the 900-pound gorilla of computer science texts, and my goal at this time.  I think that volumes I-IVA are supposed to be about two semesters full of work apiece, so this will take me quite a while.

Additionally, I want to read some books that don't really count as "textbooks" or books to be "worked through":

- **_[The Annotated Turing](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470229055/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)_ by Charles Petzold.**  I spent a semester in Advanced Logic building up to understanding Turing's paper, but I didn't really grasp it.  I'm hoping this book will help with that.

- **_[Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0735611319/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=petzold+code&qid=1638042926&qsid=140-0245398-5784867&sr=8-1&sres=0735611319%2CB08J43SJJY%2C0470229055%2C171850036X%2CB086544V5V%2CB00NP8ME30%2C0999685902%2CB00JDMPFUG%2C0470497025%2C0735619573%2CB07K14XKZH%2C1942788762%2C0735618003%2CB085NN5678%2CB000HHSHI8%2CB07Z46L5FG)_ by Charles Petzold.**  I've started this numerous times and never actually finished it.  It's a fun book, but I feel like I miss a connection somewhere.

I have a bunch of other engineering/design/language books, but those are going to be peppered in as appropriate, depending on the other challenges/interests/opportunities that pop up.
