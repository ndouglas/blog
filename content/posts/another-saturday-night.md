... and I'm running behind again.  But that's good, right?  Right?!

Today I swam, lifted weights, practiced accordion, learned a decent chunk of Unity, completed [Set 1, Challenge 6](https://cryptopals.com/sets/1/challenges/6) of the CryptoPals Crypto Challenges, made some more progress on OverTheWire's "Bandit" game, drew a horse upside down, learned some stuff about machine learning, and learned a bit more about the NES PPU.

Oh, and my kid and I watched _The Goonies_, and I helped him make some progress on his own "Bandit" experience, and he made a _Donkey Kong_-esque game in Roblox.  And that swimming and lifting weights stuff was together.  And we built LEGOs.  And I showed him how to add some more PokÃ©mon to his collection in _Legends: Arceus_ with PKHeX.

So all of that put together sounds pretty good ðŸ™‚
