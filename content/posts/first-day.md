So today's my first day of this new plan, and so far it's going fairly well.  Of course, it's Memorial Day, so I'm not working, so my obligations are low compared to normal.  And my kid's been grabbing me a lot to assist him in doing his things, so I don't know how well this will go in the future.

## Things I've Done Today

- The first day of CryptoPals.  I decided I'd do any code in Python, just because I have basically no knowledge of or experience in Python.  For whatever reason, it's just something I've never really gotten around to learning, even though I've done a couple projects and snippets elsewhere (Ansible, Beets, etc).

- The first day of Unity Essentials.  I'd done this before, but TBH it's been a while, so now I'm refreshed.

- "Bandit" Levels 1 and 2.  I was concerned that this might be sort of boring for my kid -- or way too difficult.  And it still might be.  But so far, it looks like it'll be a good little survey of basic UNIX CLI tools.

- Accordion, "Stures Schottis" and the first couple exercises from _Melodic Adventures in Bass-Land_.  I'm getting decent with the melody from the piece, although I figured out today that I was playing a small bit wrong.  If you put it all together and trim the mistakes, I think I'm playing it correctly, on-tempo, and with the correct rhythm.  The bass part for A is similarly coming together, but I'm struggling to put the left hand and right hand together.  I haven't practiced the B bass part much.  All in all, I think I'm on-track to learn this piece well.  Hope things continue to go this well.

- Kaggle, "Python".  Kaggle's helping me learn Python.  Stuff's pretty simple so far, but that's fine.  I was sufficiently ignorant of the basics that I learned a lot.

- Drawing, day one.  I put this off, lol, because I don't wanna draw myself.  But for some reason it felt a bit poignant when I actually worked on it.  The drawing was pretty lousy, of course, but not as terrible as I might've expected.  I don't think it's recognizable, though.

- Couch-to-5K!  My son and I had a water balloon fight today and I turned my right ankle, and I was of course very worried about arthritis pain.  It was not comfortable, but not very painful either.  On the whole, a success.

- Read _Five Lines of Code_.  I got about halfway through this before and really enjoyed it, so I'll read it again.  I think it's a practical and clear take on refactoring, without as theoretical/abstract an approach as e.g. _Design Patterns_.

- _Deepdown_, my little NES game.  After struggling a bit, I managed to get controls working.  The little PC now will turn left and right when those directions are pressed.  Probably the next thing to add would be jumping, but that's going to be substantially more complicated.
