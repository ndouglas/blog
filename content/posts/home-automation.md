When we bought our first house, I immediately set about the task of spending too much money home automation stuff.  I ran [Indigo](https://www.indigodomo.com/) on a Mac mini, I bought a bunch of Insteon switches, outlets, and other "smart home" devices, painstakingly programmed a programmable remote, mounted motion detectors to control switches in several different places, and then we promptly lost our house because it was the 2008 financial crisis.  Good times.

But before we lost the house, there was definitely a sense of "is this all there is?"

The home automations that I found most useful were definitely the _least_ smart -- the motion detectors that turned on the light switches in the laundry room and stairways and upstairs halls when appropriate.  The things I looked forward to most, like being able to control Plex and a DVD player and my stereo and the TV from the same remote, were absolutely agonizing to set up, unreliable, and incomprehensible to anyone but me.  Ultimately, it wasn't very smart.

So for about ten years, I really shied away from any discussion of smart homes.

A year or two back, though, it started creeping back in as an interest.  I was using timer outlets -- the kind you buy at Home Depot, with 48 or 96 segments indicating half- or quarter-hour segments of the day, and you pop some up or down to indicate when you want the outlet to be powered -- and hooking these up to planters because I wanted to grow lettuce or something, and also to power lights in my kid's bedroom so he'd get a little light show at the end of the day but they wouldn't stay on all night.

Well, these things suck -- whenever you lose power, they drift off schedule proportionally, and it's hard to set them accurately in the first place, and so forth.  Also, the ones I had were fairly noisy.

So I bought some TP-Link Kasa mini plugs, because they have a stupid-simple interface and can be set to turn on/off on a schedule (but, crucially, have external timekeeping), and there was much rejoicing.

Aaaaaaand now here I am, a year or so later, screwing with Home Assistant, Node-Red, a few dozen ESP8266/ESP32's, a Rain Machine, an Ecobee, and about twenty Kasa things.

I am digging the general ecosystem a lot more now, though.
