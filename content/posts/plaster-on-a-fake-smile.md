So I'm trying this blog thing... again. My clich√© comes from Bill Hicks: "let's plaster on a fake smile and plow through this shit again."

But I'm hoping to set down a nice rhythm that will help me grow as an engineer, avert the doomscrolling and other nonsense I too-often find myself doing outside of work, and also help with the Imposter Syndrome and everything.

My new plan starts Monday, May 30. It's a multipronged approach based on tackling some things I've been wanting to tackle for a long time, but haven't really done well.

1. **My health.** I have rheumatoid arthritis and I _think_ the medicine I take might be working now. So time to get back into weightlifting and running. I don't have fixed goals for weightlifting, because my shoulder pain and limitd mobility can just wipe out my ability to lift almost _anything_. I'm hoping to end the summer stronger and more mobile than I am now. As far as running goes, I'm _hoping_ to be able to run 5K three times a week by the end of the summer. I hope that's possible.

2. **Music.** I have been neglecting my accordion. Part of that is that the music I was trying to learn, from old lesson books, was really pretty uninteresting, and my practice technique was really, really bad. I don't think I ever really learned how to practice a musical instrument. And my strange musical background (very broad, very shallow) leads me to skip or rush early lessons. My new plan is just based on picking a song and trying to learn it in a month. My selections right now are from [_Scandinavian Folk Tunes for Accordion_](https://en.schott-music.com/shop/scandinavian-folk-tunes-for-accordion-no331019.html). I think the music's beautiful, the first song at least seems to be at a suitable level, and it avoids the common oom-pah stereotype. I'm also working through [_Melodic Adventures in Bass-Land_](https://www.amazon.com/Palmer-Hughes-Accordion-Melodic-Adventures-Bass-Land/dp/0739021729). I want to build up a really solid left hand technique.

3. **Unity.** I've taken only a few brief dips into Unity, working with my kid, and I really like it so far. I'd like to git gud and fluent and make cool demos and small games and stuff like that. I have very little experience in graphics and performance and input, etc, so I think I'll benefit tremendously. And it should be fun, and I hope it'll inspire my kid too.

4. **Kaggle.** I'm interested in data science, machine learning, etc, and I think Kaggle's courses would be a great thing to work through.

5. [**CryptoPals Crypto Challenges.**](https://cryptopals.com/) Security isn't a major interest for me, so it's possible that this will fall by the wayside. _Because_ it isn't a major interest, and it probably _should_ be, I think this is a good thing to do.

6. [**OverTheWire's "Bandit" Wargame.**](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) Again, security isn't a major interest for me, and this might get discarded. But I think this could be beneficial. I'm also encouraging my kid to complete this wargame, so I'm trying to work through it a day or two prior so that I can help him when he gets stuck and keep the experience as fluid and as informative as possible.

7. **Drawing.** I used to love drawing as a kid, and I'm super under-developed as a visual creator. I'd love to change that. I'm interested in 3-D modeling, art, etc. I'd love to be able to draw competently. I recently discovered [_Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain_](https://www.drawright.com/) and think it might be just the ticket.

8. **Reading.** I should read more; focused reading, not website reading.  Books.  I have a lot of engineering books that I should read to get deep takes on things rather than snippets from blog posts and Stack Overflow and Slack messages.

9. **React.** React's interesting to me, and adjacent to the work I'm currently doing, but I've never actually done anything in it.  I should.  This might fall by the wayside, but I found [30 Days of React](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-React), so I'll do that after I do the Hacking thing.

10. **Shaders.** I don't know much of anything about shaders, but they're cool.  I'd like to go through [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/) and create a new shader each day for 30 days or something like that.

11. **NES ROM.** I recently discovered [Famicom Party](https://famicom.party/book/).  I loved my NES when I was a kid, and I kind of miss working in assembly and dealing with low-level problems.  I think this would be a great project, and the book is so well-written I feel guilty for not doing it sooner.

12. **This Very Blog.** Blogging's a great way of sharing and resharing knowledge.  It's also good to remind myself of what I've accomplished, and to show my kid the neat things he and I can do.  I want to encourage him to keep a blog, maybe a Hugo blog like this one.

This is _a lot_, so I need to be forgiving and not burn myself out trying to do all of this.  I hope, though, that I can do a little each day and be a little more productive learning new things rather than doomscrolling, etc.

So... uh... let's see if this blog still works.

It works! :tada:
