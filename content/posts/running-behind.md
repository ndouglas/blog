So it's already been a couple days since I updated my blog.  And not because of lack of interest or lack of anything to report, but because I've been busy.  So that's great!

I've made some more progress in Bandit, crossed out the first couple things in Kaggle and Unity, and ran twice and lifted weights once.  I've drawn things!  And I've been practicing accordion fairly regularly and I feel like I'm actually making good progress.  That's all going fairly well.

I'm a cranky, resentful bastard right now, though.  I need more time to unwind, and I'm not getting it.  I'm not sure how to make up the deficit, given that whatever free time I have is swallowed up by helping my kid work through the things I'm asking of him - drums, programming, LEGO, etc.  A substantial part of the problem, maybe, is that I feel like I have things I _need_ to get done, and so they kind of hang over my head, and then I resent distractions from them.

I think I'll suggest to John that we play with water balloons and water guns on the weekends so that I get some more free time.
